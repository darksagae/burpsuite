# burpsuite
Burp Suite is a popular integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. It contains various tools that work together to support the entire testing processâ€”from initial mapping to finding vulnerabilities.

### Installation

Burp Suite is usually included in Kali Linux. If it's not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install burpsuite
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Starting Burp Suite**:
   You can launch Burp Suite from the terminal by typing:
   ```bash
   burpsuite
   ```

2. **Setting Up a Proxy**:
   Burp Suite acts as a proxy between your browser and the target web application. To use it:
   - Configure your browser to use a proxy. By default, Burp listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
   - In your browser settings, set the HTTP proxy to `127.0.0.1` and port `8080`.

3. **Intercepting Traffic**:
   - Enable the intercept option in Burp to capture requests sent from your browser.
   - You can then modify requests before they reach the target server.

### Common Tools in Burp Suite

- **Proxy**: Intercepts and modifies HTTP/S requests between your browser and the web application.
- **Scanner**: Automated tool for scanning applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Intruder**: Allows you to perform automated attacks on web applications, such as brute-forcing.
- **Repeater**: Sends requests to the server multiple times, allowing for manual testing of inputs.
- **Sequencer**: Analyzes the randomness of tokens and session identifiers.
- **Decoder**: Decodes encoded data (e.g., URL encoding, Base64).

### Examples

1. **Intercepting a Request**:
   - Set your browser to use the Burp proxy.
   - Visit a website (e.g., `http://example.com`).
   - Burp will intercept the request. You can modify the request parameters and send it to the server.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...
   ```

2. **Using the Scanner**:
   - Navigate to the "Scanner" tab.
   - Right-click on a target site in the target tab and select "Scan."

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   Scanning http://example.com
   [+] Found SQL Injection vulnerability
   [+] Found Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
   ```

3. **Using Intruder for Brute-Force**:
   - Go to the "Intruder" tab and configure a target.
   - Set positions in the request where you want to inject payloads.
   - Start the attack with a list of potential usernames or passwords.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   Fuzzing http://example.com/login
   Trying: admin
   Trying: password123
   [+] Success with: admin:password123
   ```

4. **Repeater Example**:
   - Send a request to the Repeater.
   - Modify a parameter (e.g., change a user ID) and resend it.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   POST /submit.php HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   user_id=2
   ```

### Conclusion

Burp Suite is a powerful tool for web application security testing. It provides a range of functionalities that can help identify vulnerabilities and improve security. Always ensure you have permission to test the applications you are working on to avoid legal repercussions.

- **Scanner**: Scans web applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Intruder**: Automates customized attacks on web applications.
- **Repeater**: Allows for manual testing of requests by modifying and re-sending them.

### Getting Started

1. **Launch Burp Suite**:

   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   burpsuite
   ```

2. **Configure Your Browser**:

   Set your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy (by default, it's `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

3. **Intercepting Traffic**:

   - Enable the intercept in the Proxy tab.
   - Browse the target web application. Burp Suite will capture the requests.
   - You can then modify requests before sending them to the server.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Intercepting HTTP Requests

1. **Enable Interception**:
   Go to the Proxy tab and enable interception.

2. **Send a Request**:
   When you browse to a site, Burp Suite captures the request. You can view and modify it.

3. **Forward the Request**:
   Click "Forward" to send the modified request to the server. The response will appear in Burp Suite.

**Output**:
```
GET /example HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
...
```

#### Example 2: Using the Intruder Tool

1. **Select a Target**:
   In the Proxy tab, right-click on a request and select "Send to Intruder".

2. **Configure Positions**:
   Go to the Intruder tab and configure the payload positions (e.g., replace a parameter value).

3. **Choose Payloads**:
   Select a payload type (e.g., simple list, numbers, etc.).

4. **Start Attack**:
   Click "Start Attack".

**Output**:
```
Status Code: 200
Response Length: 1234
Found: "Welcome to the admin panel"
```

#### Example 3: Using the Scanner

1. **Start a New Scan**:
   Go to the Scanner tab, right-click a target, and select "Scan".

2. **Configure Scan Options**:
   Choose options based on your needs (e.g., active scan vs. passive scan).

3. **View Results**:
   The scanner will report any vulnerabilities found.

**Output**:
```
[+] Vulnerability Detected:
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in parameter 'name'
   - SQL Injection in parameter 'id'
```

### Notes

- Always ensure you have permission to test the application.
- Use Burp Suite responsibly to avoid legal issues.
- The community and professional editions offer different features, with the latter providing advanced scanning capabilities.

Burp Suite is a popular web application security testing tool that is included in Kali Linux. It's primarily used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

**How to use Burp Suite:**

1. **Installation:** Burp Suite is pre-installed in Kali Linux. If you need to install it, you can do so with the following command: `sudo apt-get install burpsuite`
2. **Starting Burp Suite:** To start Burp Suite, navigate to the Kali Linux menu and select "Web Application Analysis" > "Burp Suite" or run the command `burpsuite` in the terminal.
3. **Configuring Burp Suite:** Once Burp Suite is started, you'll need to configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy. This allows Burp Suite to intercept and analyze the traffic between your browser and the target web application.

**Examples:**

1. **Basic Scan:** To perform a basic scan of a web application using Burp Suite, follow these steps:
	* Start Burp Suite and configure your browser to use it as a proxy.
	* Open the target web application in your browser.
	* In Burp Suite, go to the "Target" tab and add the target web application URL to the scope.
	* Click the "Scan" button to start the scan.
	* Burp Suite will identify potential vulnerabilities and display them in the "Results" tab.

**Output:**

The output of a Burp Suite scan will vary depending on the type of vulnerabilities identified. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```
**Vulnerability: SQL Injection**

* URL: http://example.com/login.php
* Parameter: username
* Type: SQL Injection
* Severity: High
* Confidence: Certain

**Request:**

GET /login.php?username=admin' OR 1=1 -- &password= password HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close

**Response:**

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

**Vulnerability Description:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the 'username' parameter. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database.

**Recommendation:**
The application should use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
```

In this example, Burp Suite has identified an SQL injection vulnerability in the `username` parameter of the `login.php` page. The output includes the request and response details, as well as a description of the vulnerability and a recommendation for remediation.
